# MazeSolver
Finds path out of a given maze using backtracking algorithm with stacks. Implemented as part of CSC 115 (Fundamentals of Programming II) course work. It built upon already introduced data structures and provided a chance to focus on problem at hand, seeing learned data structures in action.

# Concepts
- Data Structures, stacks
- Designing/implementing algorithms
- Reading and building upon existing code
